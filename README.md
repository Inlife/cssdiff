A tool to help you in your everyday developer routine!<br>Just copy-paste your css styles to get started.

# Description

This is a tool, that can help you to calculate a difference between 2 CSS files. Let's say you are a developer, who's task is to update site css files. 

But your frontend developer doesn't use any type of VCS. It sucks, now you need to manually look for changed styles and copy-paste them into your own css file.

**Well, not anymore!** Now you can just insert content of your old stylesheet file, insert content from a new stylesheet file, and voilà!

# Result

This 2 blocks below are showing difference between css you've inputed. **Removed blocks** section describes style blocks that were removed from first file, or modified (in which case they will be shown also in *Added* section).

**Added blocks** is a sections which describes style blocks that were added in the second file, and/or were modified from first file.
